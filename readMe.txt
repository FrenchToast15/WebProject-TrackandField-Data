This project has users make an account if they dont have one and then log in to that account. 
It uses a database to store all of the usernames and passwords.
Once they are logged in, if they arent an admin, they can view the results that the admin has posted.
If they are an admin they can also add more records and also view the existing records.
We use another database to store the name, event, performance, gender, and year of the data that was entered.
